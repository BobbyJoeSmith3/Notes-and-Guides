Principles of Web Design

Design Theory 101:
Content is king. Your design should reflect the spirit of the content. The designer's primary task is to interpret and communicate the content.

3 Attributes that influence design:
1)Target audience:
	Age? Race? Gender? Cultural Niche?
2)Tone:
	Casual? Formal? Friendly? Sarcastic?
3)Purpose:
	Informational? Conversions?

Typography is verbal and visual. The reader first observes the overall graphical patterns of the page and then they parce the language and read. Different typefaces create different moods that can serve your content well.
