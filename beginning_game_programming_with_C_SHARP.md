Beginning Game Programming with C#
==================================

What is programming?
1.	Source Code (code that's in a format that programmers can easily understand, but that the computer can't understand)
2.	Compile/build source code into an executable (translate the source code into a language that the computer can understand so that it can be executed )
3. 	Run the executable
4. 	Debug!

Integrated Development Environment (IDE)-
an IDE like Visual Studio lets us type our source code, compile, build, run, and debug from a single environment.

XNA-
XNA is a game framework built for windows. The MonoGame framework is built ontop of XNA and allows us to build for other platforms like Android, iOS, etc.

In the Xarmin Studio IDE, ```command+B``` builds the source code by compiling (using the C# compiler) the code into a Common Intermediate Language.

The .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) runs all Common Intermediate Language

```///``` is how you write multi-line comments for documentation

```//``` is how you write in-line comments

```Console.WriteLine("write message here");``` is how you print a message to the screen
