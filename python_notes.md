Python Notes
============

###Exponentiation
All that math can be done on a calculator, so why use Python? Because you can combine math with other data types (e.g. **booleans**) and commands to create useful programs. Calculators just stick to numbers.

Now let's work with exponents.

```eight = 2 ** 3```

In the above example, we create a new variable called ```eight``` and set it to ```8```, or the result of ```2``` to the power to ```3 (2^3)```.

Notice that we use ```**``` instead of ```*``` or the multiplication operator.


###Modulo
Our final operator is **modulo**. **Modulo** returns the remainder from a division. So, if you type ```3 % 2```, it will return ```1```, because 2 goes into 3 evenly once, with 1 left over.


###Bringing It All Together
Nice work! So far, you've learned about:

- **Variables**, which store values for later use
- **Data types**, such as numbers and booleans
- **Whitespace**, which separates statements
- **Comments**, which make your code easier to read
- **Arithmetic operations**, including ```+```, ```-```, ```*```, ```/```, ```**```, and ```%```
